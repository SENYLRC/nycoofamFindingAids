							<p>Coll. No. 268: Burr - Hamilton Duel Collection is open for research according to the regulations of Fenimore Art Museum Library.</p>
						</accessrestrict>
						<bioghist>
							<p>A political rivalry developed between Aaron Burr (1756-1836), Vice President of the United States from 1801 to 1805, and Alexander Hamilton (1757-1804), Secretary of the Treasury from 1789 to 1795, when Hamilton repeatedly used his influence to oppose Burr's ambitions, often attacking his motives and character. A reference printed in the Albany Register of April 24, 1804, at the time of Burr's defeat for governor of New York, led to the fateful correspondence which culminated in the tragic "interview" (their euphemism for a duel) at Weehawken, N.J. </p>
            <p>Between the dates of June 18 and July 9, 1804, an extensive correspondence took place between Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, and their appointed seconds, Nathaniel Pendleton for Hamilton and William P. Van Ness for Burr, in an attempt to resolve the confrontation initiated by Burr's reaction to Hamilton's statement in the  Register. </p>
            <p>During the course of the correspondence, both men declined to resolve the dispute when opportunities arose.  Burr's patience was finally exhausted by Hamilton's long practice of criticism and vilification and he demanded an apology for all the derogatory remarks Hamilton had ever made about him. Hamilton felt he would destroy his own reputation if he refuted a position he believed to be based on truth. Both men refused to make the statements which would have enabled them to defuse the confrontation. 
</p>
            <p>On July 11, 1804, Burr, Hamilton, and their seconds crossed the Hudson River from New York in boats and held their now famous duel at a site near Weehawken. In the duel, Burr shot and killed Hamilton.</p>
