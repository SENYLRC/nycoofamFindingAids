            <p>Chauncey Hill (1787-1854) married Nancy Loomis (1790-1845). They had a son Erastus (1827-1885) who married Harriet Robinson (1826-1893). Erastus and Harriet had six children including Nancy (1858-1934), who married William Mason (1856-1915), and Alvin Erastus Hill (1867-1938) who married Mary Murdock (1873-1969). Alvin E. and Mary had two sons including Francis Hill (ca. 1906- ).</p>
        <head>Biography/History</head>
        <p>Chauncey Hill had a farm in Smithville, Chenango County, NY, on the over 220 acres of land he owned in Oxford/Smithville, NY. Hill was a lumber dealer. According to the donors, most of the lumber was white pine. It was cut and sawed around Addison, Steuben County, NY and shipped by raft from that area to Baltimore, MD. From at least 1830-1840, Hill’s partner in the lumber business was Elijah Haynes, who owned a dry goods business in Greene, NY. Also, in partnership with Haynes, Hill owned half of the Addison Store, Addison, Steuben County, NY. </p>
            <p>Alvin E. Hill operated a dairy farm, ca. 1890s-1930s, located in an area called, “the triangle” since parts of the farm were in the towns of Oxford, Smithville, and Greene, Chenango County, NY. (Modern day location - 3143 Route 12, Oxford, NY).</p>
            <p>Willian Manson’s farm, the Lakeview Dairy and Poultry Farm, was located on RFD No. 3 (modern-day location - Williams Road), Oxford, NY. It was in operation in the early 1900s.</p>
            <p>Francis Hill’s saw mill and lumberyard was located on Route 12, South Oxford, NY. It was in operation in the mid-1900s. He sold his lumber to Bailey, Genesee County, NY wholesaler Warren TenBroeck.
