						<bioghist>
							<p>John Davenport Clarke (1873-1933) was a U.S. Congressman who served Delaware, Otsego, Chenango, and Broome Counties in New York State from 1921 to 1925 and 1927 to 1933. He was born in Hobart, Delaware County, N.Y., graduated from Lafayette College in PA, and received a law degree from Brooklyn Law School. Prior to becoming a Congressman, he was a farmer and worked for the mining departments of Carnegie Steel Co. and the United States Steel Corp. During his years in Congress he was closely involved with local dairy and shoemaking interests and with land conservation. As a stimulus to local 4-H activities, he turned much of his property in Fraser, Delaware County, NY into a recreation site for their benefit. Clarke died while in office in 1933 and his seat was taken over by his wife, Marian Williams Clarke, until early 1935.
