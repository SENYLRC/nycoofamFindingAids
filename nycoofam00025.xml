            <p>Cecily Irene Johnson was born to W. D. Johnson and Cecily J. Arries. Dodd married Robert Brosseau Lutes in 1919. They had two children, Mary J. and Willard Johnson. In 1948, Lutes married a second time to Kenneth L. Dodd. Except for a time in the late 1920s to the 1930s when she lived in Bedford, MA, Cecily Dodd seems to have lived her whole life in Cooperstown where she was active in the Native Daughters of Cooperstown. </p>
