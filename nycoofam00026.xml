            <abstract>Included in this collection is Green’s journal which describes his journey from upstate New York to Mississippi where he acquires a teaching position, his social and professional activities, encounters with slaves and his detestation of slavery, and his health, which along with his distaste for “the country,” precipitates his return North. The journal picks up again as Greene is practicing law in Livingston County, NY and documents his professional, familial and social activities, and his health.</abstract>

        <bioghist>
            <p>Paul Wheeler Green[e] was born on June 5, 18-- of parents B. and C. Greene. He and brothers William C., Olin, Irving G., and perhaps Clark lived around Richmond, Ontario County, NY. In 1845 he and his sister attended the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary, Lima, NY. Prior to July 1851, Green was connected with Cayuga Academy, Aurora, Cayuga County, NY and excelled in Latin and Greek language. </p>
        <head>Biography/History</head>
        <p>In October 1851 he departed New York for Mississippi where he acquired a teaching position near Grenada, MS, then in September 1852, in Oakachickama, Yalabusha County, MS. His health failing and his aversion to conditions in the South increasing, he left in November 1852 to return home to Richmond. In 1854 still in ill-health, he lived and practiced law at Dannsville, Livingston County, NY. He died in December of that year and is buried at Honeoye, Ontario County, NY.</p>

            <p>The letters from Paul W. Green, written in 1852 from Mississippi to his brothers and father, chronicle a harrowing incident involving the murder of a man named Bingham and the subsequent torture and hanging of two black men who were his slaves, his teaching career, news of friends and family, his disapproval of slavery, his state of health, opinions on farming as a profession, and his plans for the future.</p>
        <head>Scope and Contents</head>
        <p>The 1851 letters from Otis E. Wood, Cayuga Academy, Aurora, to Green, recommend Green to prospective employers and give him encouragement. The 1852 letter from Hiram Pitts, Moline, IA outlines the advantages and disadvantages of settling in Iowa. The 1854 letter from James E. Crenshaw, Preston, MS comments on Green’s health, encourages him to find a wife, gives news of acquaintances in Mississippi; and discourses on the advantages of slavery, what would happen if slaves were freed, presidential politics, secession, the fugitive slave bill, and the complicity of the North in the slave trade.</p>
            <p>In the 13-page paper Paul Greene writes on the need of “force of character” in a young man’s life. </p>
            <p>The “journal” is comprised of several sections: a listing of accounts (Hartford, January 1-March 31, 1838 and Richmond, September 1 – October 15, 1847), description of the properties of various elements and chemical compounds,  a “List of my Books” with title, when purchased, and price; a “Common place Book” with long essays on the history of Rome and on laws, rights, and rules; a second listing of accounts (Lyons, January 3-March 28, 1848); descriptions of four talks on Jerusalem, death, setting standards, and the “probable destiny of the Negro race,” and 25 pages of pressed flowers and their foliage, identified as to Latin and common names. </p>
            <p>The bulk of the volume, however, contains journal entries.  The first set (October 14, 1851-December 11, 1852) describes Greene’s journey from upstate New York to Mississippi where he acquires a teaching position in Grenada, his social and professional activities, friends, “scholars,” encounters with slaves and his detestation of slavery, and his health, which declines considerably during his stay and along with his distaste for “the country,” precipitates his return North.</p>
            <p>The second set (March 31 – November 17, 1854) picks up again as Greene is apparently practicing law in Dannsville, Livingston County, NY and documents his professional, familial, and social activities, and his health which continues to get worse despite taking “water cures.”</p>
