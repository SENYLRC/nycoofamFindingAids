        <bioghist>
            <p>Jacob S. Glen was born in Schenectady, NY in 1773. A principal landholder, he owned 10,000 acres of the DeLancey Patent, a patent that became available after the Revolutionary War. Among Glen’s holdings was a considerable part of the Town of Charlestown. In 1802, he married Catherine Visscher, 1776-1827.  In 1818, using clay from his farm, he constructed a kiln and built a brick store and house in the town that was to be named after its prominent citizen. In April 1823, the Town of Glen was officially formed from the Town of Charleston. He died at the age of 86 in 1859 and was buried in Glen, NY.</p>
