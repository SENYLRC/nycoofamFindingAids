            <p>Judge Alden Chester, 1848-1934, was born in Westford, NY Otsego County. He served as a clerk in a country store in Westford, and as a telegraphy operator in the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad office in East Worcester, NY, edited an Otsego County newspaper (The Valley News), and served as a clerk for Aetna Life Insurance Company in Boston. </p>
        <head>Biography/History</head>
        <p>While in Boston he commenced the study of law and entered the Columbia College Law School in New York City where he graduated in 1871. He then began practicing law in Albany with his cousin Andrew S. Draper. From 1882-1885 he served as assistant US district attorney for the Northern District on NY. From 1887 until 1895, he practiced alone. In 1895, he was elected to the Third Judicial District Supreme Court; he was re-elected in 1909 at the end of his first 14-year term. He was designated to the Appellate Division by Gov. Odell and served from 1902 to 1909. He then returned to the trial bench at the behest of Gov. Hughes to help clear an unusual backlog of cases.</p>
            <p> He retired from the bench at the end of 1918, having reached 70 years of age. He also served as president of the Albany Medical College, a trustee of the Albany College of Pharmacy, a governor of Union University, and a special lecturer on the Federal judicial system at Albany Law School. He was president of the American Bar Association in 1918. Judge Chester married Lina Thurber, East Worcester, NY in 1871. They had one child, Amy, born 1877.  </p>
            <p>Horace Chester, 1842-1926, older brother of Alden, was born in the town of Westford, Otsego County, NY. After taking business courses in New York City he located at Schenevus, Otsego County, New York where he took charge of public schools and of the business of the Albany &amp; Susquehanna Railroad Company until 1870. He then entered the banking business operating the Thompson, Chester &amp; Company Bank in Schenevus, and in 1874 established the Bank of Worcester, Otsego County, New York. When his affiliation with this bank ended, in 1886, he organized the Chester Banking and Exchange Office in Schenevus. Horace Chester married Anastasia E. Hill in 1867. They had four children, Carey R., L. Fannie, H. Coryell, and Lola E. He died in Maiden, MA.
