							<p>Smalley Theatres, Inc. was a movie theater chain in central New York State, headed by William C. Smalley, with a home office in Cooperstown. Smalley started his first theater in Mount Upton in 1913, and began operating in Cooperstown in 1916. While the chain continued to add new locations after this, it was not officially incorporated until 1930. At the time of Smalley's death in 1952, he owned or controlled twelve theaters, down from a peak of twenty-three. His widow, Hazel (Smith) Smalley, continued to operate the chain after his death, although it dwindled in numbers. She sold the Cooperstown theater near the end of 1959, leaving only three in the chain.</p>

							<p>This collection consists of the records of Smalley Theatres, Inc., accumulated at its home office in Cooperstown, N.Y., 1912-1955. The daily and weekly statements, which constitute a significant portion of the records, were collected from the theaters in Camden, Cooperstown, Delhi, Dolgeville, Fort Plain, Hensonville, Johnstown, Norwich, Oxford, Sharon Springs, Sidney, St. Johnsville, Stamford, and Walton, N.Y., before coming to the home office. They provide excellent detail on attendance and box office receipts for films shown at each location.</p><p>Financial documents are extensive (particularly account books), as is correspondence. The latter supplies much evidence on the importance of film distribution to a movie theater chain, among other subjects. Additional records of note include photographs (especially publicity shots of film stars), documentation of legal cases, programs, lists of free passes provided to prominent local individuals, along with several diaries of William C. Smalley.</p>
