        <bioghist>
            <p>Jedlick’s avid interest in painted window shades of the 19th century arose in 1967 from his search for a research topic while a student at the Cooperstown Graduate Program, Cooperstown, NY. His resulting Masters Thesis, "Landscape Window Shades of the 19th Century in New York and New England," started him on a trail of discovery that he pursued into the 1980s as he researched, consulted on, photographed, collected, appraised, and dealt in painted window shades, and lent them to museums for exhibition.</p>
        <head>Biography/History</head>
        <p>In 1968-1969, he consulted with Ruth Lee, Publicity Director for Joanna Western Mills, Co., Chicago, Illinois, on her 22 page booklet, Shades of History.  Around that same time, Jedlick served as Associate Curator and Assistant Director of the Chicago Historical Society, and from about 1974-1987 as Regional Museum Curator for the National Park Service, N. E. Region, Philadelphia, PA. In 1987, Jedlick was also appraising antiques for W.J. Jedlick Appraisers, Philadelphia, PA.  His first Masters Thesis, written while a student at DePaul University, Chicago, IL, in 1953, was entitled “Letters of Morris Sleight on the California Trail, 1850.</p>
