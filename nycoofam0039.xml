            <p>The original order of the business records has been maintained as far as possible. Material from 1900-1909 was carefully scrutinized and ordered. Material after 1909 was simply transferred from original files to acid free folders. Brackets around folder descriptions indicate contents are not a part of original arrangement. A strict chronological order was imposed on these scattered papers. In some instances, material was interfiled with later business records. This material can be identified by typed labels.

							<p>Firm of Corbett and Stuart, with main offices in Binghamton, N.Y., produced wood distillation substances such as charcoal, wood alcohol, and acetate of lime.</p>
            <p>Sewell Corbett (1785-1852) was a farmer and the owner of a saw mill, a grist mill, a foundry, and a general store in Corbettsville, N.Y. Julius Smith Corbett (1831-1899), only son of Sewell Corbett, ran his father's various businesses until 1881, when he moved to Binghamton. With John Emmons, V. Mandville, and Mr. Nitckee, Julius Corbett established a wood chemical plant in Livingston Manor, N.Y. Julius Corbett later began building a plant in Rockland, N.Y., which his son Merritt John Corbett (b. 1865) completed in 1885 and operated for a short time (1887?). Julius and Merritt Corbett also purchased a plant in Sherman, Pa. (Sherman Manufacturing Company).</p>
            <p>In 1887, Merritt Corbett took his brother-in-law, John Leonard Stuart, on as a partner. The firm of Corbett &amp; Stuart began operations at Harvard, N.Y. In 1889, they built another wood chemical plant at East Branch, N.Y. (Morris Brook Works). In 1891, they built a plant at Peaksville, N.Y. (Trout Brook Works). The plant at St. Mary's, Pa. (M.J. Corbett &amp; Co.) was built from 1897 to 1898. In 1911, a plant at Corbett, N.Y. (Corbett &amp; Stuart) was built. In 1912, a plant at Milanville, Pa. (Milanville Chemical Co.) was purchased. Refining plants for the manufacture of acetone, formaldehyde, and pure methyl alcohol were built at St. Mary's and at Wells, Michigan (Delta Chemical Co.) from 1914 to 1915. </p>
