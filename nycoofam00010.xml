        <bioghist>
            <p>In 1876, the Woman’s Baptist Missionary Society of New Lisbon, Otsego County, NY was organized to aid “in the work of the Christian Elevation of women in foreign lands.” The group raised money in a variety of ways, making contributions to the church for improvements and decorations, and to Baptist missionary projects. In August 1912, the “Foreign and Home missionary societies were combined.” Thereafter, until at least 1920, the New Lisbon society was known as the “Woman’s Baptist Home and Foreign Missionary Society.”</p>
