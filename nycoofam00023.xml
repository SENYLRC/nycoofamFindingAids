        <bioghist>
            <p>Mary Louise Austin was born in 1919 in Lebanon, Madison County, NY, daughter of Florence A. and Arthur T. Ryan. Her childhood was spent on the family farm at Hamilton, Madison County, NY. After graduating from Hamilton High School in 1937, she received a bachelor’s degree from Denison University, Greenville, Ohio, in 1941 and with a master’s from the University of Chicago School of Social Work in 1943. </p>
        <head>Biography/History</head>
        <p>She married James Cuthbert Austin of Hamilton in 1942.  After marriage she worked for the Girl Scouts of America as an outreach coordinator in Saratoga. Initially living in Elmira where Mary Louise worked at the AOM Hospital, the couple moved to Oneonta, Otsego County, NY in 1958. They had seven children: Anne Cuthbert, James Curtiss, Sarah Olcott, Christopher Austin, Thomas Pendell, Elizabeth, and David Greenfield Austin.</p>
            <p>Mary Louise was an active member of the First Presbyterian Church, League of Women Voters, Adirondack Mountain Club, Oneonta Garden Club and Oneonta Book Club. Along with these interests, in the 1970s she amassed an extensive collection of photographic slides of, in her words, “old buildings.” Originally local in scope to the Oneonta area, the collection broadened to cover much of upstate New York State. Austin died, in Oneonta, in 2016.</p>
