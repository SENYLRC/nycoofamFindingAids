							<p>James Byard, Jr. (1872-1942) was a lawyer and politician in Otsego County, N.Y. He was admitted to the bar in 1900 and practiced law in Cooperstown, N.Y. until 1923 when he moved his offices to Oneonta, N.Y. He was a delegate from New York at the Democratic National Convention in 1912, and a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives from New York's 34th District during the same year. He is most known as the council for the defense in the famous Eva Coo murder trial of 1934. He was killed in an automobile accident near Albany, N.Y. in 1942.
