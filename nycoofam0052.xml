        <abstract>The John E. Wyman Collection consists primarily of material relating to the early history of New York and some material relating to Connecticut. The collection includes a variety of manuscripts (1695-1917; bulk 1750-1840) collected and organized by John E. Wyman of Fonda, N.Y. The New York State Historical Association purchased the collection from the Wyman family in 1950. With the manuscripts, NYSHA acquired a calendar, probably compiled by John Wyman, which includes transcriptions and/or descriptions of more than 1,000 of the 1,100 plus documents originally in the collection. </abstract></did>
        <processinfo>
            <p>The collection has been arranged numerically by Wyman number, with any unnumbered items in the back of each folder. The second OVS+ folder (222.002) has no Wyman numbers.
</p><p>Wyman organized the collection roughly by subject; however, not all subject areas originally identified by Wyman are represented among the holdings. Conversely, some documents collected but not calendared by Wyman are in this Collection.</p>
